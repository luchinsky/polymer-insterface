# polymer-insterface
A collection of scripts to create model and analyze results of MD simulations of polymer blends with polymer-polymer interface

### The collection 
contains the following main folders
 - equilibration (initial equilibration of the sample), which consists of
   -   initial nve equilibration
   -   npt compression at high pressure 1000-2000 atm
   -   nve equilibration after compression at high pressure
